**Overview of Spreadsheet Functionality:**
This Spreadsheet program is currently capable of taking in a mathematical infix expression and a delegate
that takes a string and returns an int. The program can then use those two parameters to solve the given 
expression as long as it is valid. A valid expression is defined above the Evaluate method in the 
FormulaEvaluator. The Spreadsheet program is also capable of identifying dependent and dependee relationships.
This means that the Spreadsheet knows which "cells" must be calculated first and which ones can be calculated
later ie. which "cells" depend on other "cells" to be calculated. NOTE: The Spreadsheet is not capable of
identifying cycles, so the "cell" A1 could have the formula A1 + A2 in this iteration of the Spreadsheet.
