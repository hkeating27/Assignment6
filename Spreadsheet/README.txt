**Comments to Evaluators:**
My work stands on its own.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
I found it kind of annoying that there wasn't any detail about how the Set methods should be interacting with
our DependencyGraph and Dictionary of Cells (that was what I chose to represent all nonempty cells in my ss).
I understand that we can't and shouldn't have every single detail of implmentation handed to us, but even a
comment of just "think about how Excel does this" would have been helpful. I also think it is a bit odd that
the SetContents(name, text) and the SetContents(name, formula) have the requirement of checking to see if
text and formula is null, but the SetContents(name, number) does not have you check if number is null.


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if I had a question and asked a question myself.


**References:**
No references used besides my brain, lectures, and Piazza. I also used the AbstractSpreadsheet class that
was given in the assignment details.
