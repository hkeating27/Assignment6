**Comments to Evaluators:**
My work stands on its own.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
Can we never use a console application to test our assignments ever again? It is inefficient and
wildly annoying.


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza
if I had a question and asked a question myself.


**References:**
I did not use any reference besides my brain for the SpreadsheetTests.
