**Comments to Evaluators:**
My work stands on its own.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
I'm not sure if I tested everything as thoroughly as I needed to. I know the constructor is tested
very heavily, but methods like ToString and GetVariables have like 3-4 total tests between them.


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if I had a question and asked a question myself.


**References:**
I did not use any reference besides my brain and what was given in the assignment details
for the FormulaTests.
