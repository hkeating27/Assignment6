**Comments to Evaluators:**
I posted a question to piazza about whether or not empty parenthesis was okay. A student responded that if 
empty parenthesis are present then an error should be thrown. I could not figure out how to throw an error
for this without breaking something else and since (at the time I submitted my project) an instructor hadn't
confirmed this I decided not to throw an error for it.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
I don't really have any feedback, more of a question. Are we able to assume that edge cases that no
reasonable person would hit don't need to be tested? For example, no reasonable person using a spreadsheet
would enter a formula like: 8 * () 2 - 3.


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if I had a question and asked a question myself.
