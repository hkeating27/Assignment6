**Comments to Evaluators:**
My work stands on its own.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
It would have been helpful if the API specified which methods need to be O(1) and which ones
can be O(n).


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza and
if I had a question and asked a question myself.


**References:**
No references used besides my brain, lectures, and Piazza. I also used the Formula shell that
was given in the assignment details.
