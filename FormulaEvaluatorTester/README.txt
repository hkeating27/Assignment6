**Comments to Evaluators:**
I posted a question to piazza about whether or not empty parenthesis was okay. A student responded that if 
empty parenthesis are present then an error should be thrown. I could not figure out how to throw an error
for this without breaking something else and since (at the time I submitted my project) an instructor hadn't
confirmed this I decided not to throw an error for it.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
Can we never use a console application to test our assignments ever again? It is inefficient and
wildly annoying.


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if I had a question and asked a question myself.


**References:**
I did not use any reference besides my brain for the FormulaEvaluatorTester.
